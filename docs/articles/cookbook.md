# Requesting Assets

- Production cookbook/examples (various ways to use AssetHelper to load assets in prod)
  - Mention that it's good to list the exact game objects you need, not their common ancestor.
  For example, if you need root/child1 and root/child2, let AssetHelper decide whether to
  repack the root or to repack both child1 and child2 without touching the root.
- Maybe advertise the debugtools here
